#respimage - Mutation plugin

The mutation plugin extends ``respimage`` to automatically detect new responsive images in the document and additionally detects relevant attribute changes for responsive images. It also re-normalizes the ``getAttribute`` method in conjunction with the ``src`` and the ``srcset`` attribute.

##Download and embed
Simply download the ``ri.mutation.min.js`` and include it after the respimage script:

```html
<script src="respimage.min.js"></script>
<script src="ri.mutation.min.js"></script>
```

Of course it is recommend to combine your scripts.
